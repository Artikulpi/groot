Just another simple web CMS.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************

$ git clone https://github.com/Artikulpi/groot.git
$ cd groot
$ php composer.phar install

Create mysql database, and then import sql files :
* db/structure.sql
* db/data.sql

That's all, you can browse your new Groot instalation : http://localhost/groot
